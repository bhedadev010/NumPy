np.sort = Return a sorted copy of an array.
          Can be sorted according to axis also

np.append = The numpy.append() appends values along the mentioned axis at the end of the array
            Can be appended according to axis also

np.concatenate = function concatenate a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.

np.unique = With the help of np.unique() method, we can get the unique values from an
            array given as parameter in np.unique() method.

np.expand_dims = With the help of Numpy.expand_dims() method, we can get the expanded
                 dimensions of an array

np.argmax/argmin = The numpy.argmax() function returns indices of the max element of the
                   array in a particular axis.
                   Can be found according to axis according to axis also

np.cumsum = function is used when we want to compute the cumulative sum of array
            elements over a given axis
            Can be added according to axis according to axis also

np.cumprod = same as cumsum

np.percentile = function used to compute the nth percentile of the given data
                (array elements) along the specified axis.

np.histogram = Numpy has a built-in numpy.histogram() function which represents the frequency
               of data distribution in the graphical form.

np.corrcoef = Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.

np.isin = With the help of numpy.isin() method, we can see that one array having values
          are checked in a different numpy array having different elements with different sizes.
          - ANSWER CAN BE FOUND IN TWO FORMATS

np.flip = The numpy.flip() function reverses the order of array elements along the specified
          axis, preserving the shape of the array.
          Can be flipped according to axis according to axis also

np.put = The numpy.put() function replaces specific elements of an array with given values
         of p_array. Array indexed works on flattened array.

np.delete = The numpy.delete() function returns a new array with the deletion of sub-arrays
            along with the mentioned axis.

Set functions =
               -np.union1d = returns unique eleemnts from both
               -np.intersect1d = common in both
               -np.setdiff1d = returns unique elements which are present in a and not in b
               -np.setxor1d = returns elements which are not present in a and b common
               -np.in1d

np.clip = numpy.clip() function is used to Clip (limit) the values in an array.
