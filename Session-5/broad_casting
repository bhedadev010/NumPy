BROAD CASTING = The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats array with different shapes
                during arithmetic operations.
                The smaller array is 'broadcast' across the larger array so they have compatible
                shapes.

RULES:
      i) MAKE TWO ARRAY HAVE SAME NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS

      ii) MAKE EACH DIMENSION OF TWO ARRAYS THE SAME SIZE
