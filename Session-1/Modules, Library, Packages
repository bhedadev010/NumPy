1) What are python modules, library and packages.

Ans) Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large unbind programming task into separate smaller more manageable sub task on module.
     Individual modules can be collab together like building block to create large application.
     There are several advantages of modular programming:

     i) Simplicity: Rather than focusing on the entire problem on hand, a module focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem.

    ii) Maintainability : Modules are designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domain.

   iii) Reusability : Functionality defines in a single module, can be easily reused by other part of programs.


2) Python Modules

Ans) Modules are predefined files that contain python code which shows the basic functionality of class methods, variables.
     It consist of different function class in a group of files inside a directory.

     Modules can also be turned into library, these are basically predefined methods that can be used to make code more efficient and reduce efforts.
     Modules line the code and reduce the repetition of function frequently used in the code thus makes it easy to understand.
     Modules content are accessed with the import statement.

     A library is a collection of modules but the terms are often use interchangable specially since many library only consist of single module.

     Ex of popular pyhton library:
     -os  -moth  -time  -NumPy  -SciPy  -Pandas  -Matplotlib  -seaborn


3) NumPy

Ans) NumPy is a python package, it stands for Numeric Python. It is a library consisting of multi dimensional array, objects and collection of routines for processing of array.
     NumPy package is a work of data analytics, machine learning, etc.

     Why NumPy?

     NumPy data structure perform better in:

     Memory: Takes up less space

     Performance: Need for speed and are faster than list.

     Functionality: SciPy and NumPy have optimized functions which are built in.
